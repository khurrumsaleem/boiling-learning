The experiment was almost a reproduction from Supplementary video 1, part of Visualization-based nucleate boiling heat flux quantification using machine learning, by Gustavo M. Hobold and Alexandre K. da Silva.
Main conclusions:
- There appears to be no relationthip between the Wire Temperatura [Â°C] values and the actual wire temperature;
- CHF seems to be near 80 W/cm^2, or 0.8 * 10^6 W/m^2, which is very close to what was reported by Nikiyama, but slightly inferior. Hobold also reported greater values for CHF;
- Histeresis was observed in film boiling: although incandescence starts near 80 W/cm^2, it may be necessary to reduce the heat flux to a value as low as 50 W/cm^2 for it to stop;
- I need a better support for the photographic reflector;
