This experiment is intended to test the thermocouple. Some points were noted:
- There were two peaks in the measured heat flux when the auxiliary heaters were turned on;
- Nothing was noted when the power source was connected to the electrical network (while kept off);
- The thermocouple description is:
    - Silver-welded, with a big silver drop;
    - Non-calibrated, K-type thermocouple;
- Thermocouple and RTD measurements are less than 2Â°C different;
