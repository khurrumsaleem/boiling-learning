# Notes on this project

## Experimental

### Wire temperature measurement

- Capacitive discharge will no longer be used. Reasons:
  - The welding of the thermocouple creates a new material that should be calibrated. However, by inserting the thermocouple together with the wire into the calibration chamber, the whole system's temperatura will be uniform, and ir will behave just like a perfect, undamaged thermocouple. On the other hand, during the experiment, there is a strong temperature gradient through the resistance-welding point-thermocouple wires system, leading to high errors.
  - Because the two legs of the thermocouple cannot be welded for sure at the same axial position, there are two factors for voltage drop between them: the first one, the one we want to measure, is a voltage drop caused by the temperature difference between our system and the cold joint; the second one is a voltage drop due to the current that flows through the test wire, amounting to over 900Â°C for a distance of 1mm between the thermocouple legs

- \[DISCARDED\] Problems using a ceramic capsule: the thermocouple does not capture the wire temperature.
- Problems with the silver-welding:
  - The base material is damaged due to the high temperatures.
  - There is a big fin, the welding point. A new technique allows us to reduce this effect.
