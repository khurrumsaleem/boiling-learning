# About

Project developed by me, [Ruan Comelli](https://github.com/ruancomelli), at [UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina)](https://ufsc.br/) in order to obtain a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

# Versioning

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with an additional convention: since we are still in initial development, the major version is zero: `v0.y.z`; number `y` will be incremented whenever backward incompatible changes are introduced to the API (thus `y` plays the role of the major version for stable APIs), whereas number `z` will be incremented for bug fixes, backward compatible changes, deprecations etc. (this way, `z` combines stable APIs' minor and patch version numbers).

# Upcoming

- Improved README.
